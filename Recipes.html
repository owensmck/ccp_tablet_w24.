            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.</p>   
            <p>They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert. </p>

            <p>Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that has been around since 1920. It is a hot sandwich made with buttered and toasted bread and originally filled with American cheese, but is now commonly made with one or more different cheeses.</p>
          
            <h4>Recipe Ingredients</h4>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>8 slices Texas toast</li>
                <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>4 slices medium cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>4 slices Gouda cheese</li>
                <li>4 slices Havarti cheese</li>        
            </ol>

            <h4>Recipe Steps</h4>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices of bread in the skillet with the butter-side-down.</li>
                <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda. Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with the crisp sides on the outside.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on medium low for the breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and adhere to the bread.</li>
                <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.</li>    
            </ol>

            <p>This Grinder Sandwich recipe went viral on TikTok last year, and for good reason.</p>
            <p>Itโs loaded with various meats and cheeses and packed with flavor thanks to its signature creamy Grinder salad.</p> 
            <p>This hearty sandwich is assembled atop a sliced Italian sandwich loaf with a spread of Calabrian chili paste and dressed up with slices of tomato, extra onion, and lots of freshly grated parmesan to take it over the top.</p>

            <h4>Recipe Ingredients</h4>
            <h5>Salad</h5>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>1/4 thinly sliced red onion</li>
                <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
                <li>3 minced garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1/2 head of iceberg lettuce</li>

            <h5>Sandwich</h5>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Italian loaves</li>
                <li>Calabrian paste</li>
                <li>2 slices Havarti cheese</li>
                <li>2 slices Colby jack</li>
                <li>3 slices salami</li>
                <li>3 slices prosciutto</li>
                <li>3 slices spicy pepperoni</li>
                <li>Fresh parmesan</li>
                <li>1 tomato</li>

            </ol>

            <h4>Recipe Steps</h4>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the red onion to a bowl, pour some cold water over it, and let it sit. This will take away some of the bitterness. Whisk the mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, oregano, red pepper, and garlic cloves. Add in the lettuce, onion, and pepperoncini, and give it a taste. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Slice the bread in half and add Calabrian chili paste to both sides of the bread. Add the cheese to one of the halves. Add the meats to the other half. Transfer to the oven to bake for about 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the meat is warmed. Add the salad on top of the meat, along with a few slices of tomato, fresh onion, and parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Slice in half and enjoy.</li>
